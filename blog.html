        <h2>Reflection During the Pandemic</h2>
        <p class="date">March 2021</p>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>Before the pandemic, I barely thought about my health. I spent most of my time gaming and skipping meals. During the pandemic, I made some changes and felt better for it. Lately, I've slipped back into old habits.</p>
            <p>I'm opening a Discord server to track my self-improvement and stay on course. It's not just about staying healthy — it's about taking charge of my routine and making lasting change.</p>
            <p>This post reminds me how important it is to reflect, regroup, and recommit to our goals — even when we fall off track.</p>

        <h2>Behold the Algorithmic Canvas, Fellow Digital Voyagers!</h2>
        <p class="date">May 2025</p>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
                Once handcrafted by humans, the digital world is now smeared with the chaotic charm of AI-generated images—equal parts hilarious, uncanny, and weirdly profound. Picture a flamingo-legged horse parallel parking a sentient toaster, or a cat in a fedora chairing a squirrel board meeting. Early AI art wasn’t brilliance—it was digital Dada, pure algorithmic absurdity.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s a toddler-dream logic to it all. Cats become cubist fever dreams. Celebrities morph into meme-chimeras. Landscapes ignore gravity. And the internet? Oh, it lives for this chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                But beneath the laughs lurk serious questions. What happens when AI gets too good? What about artist livelihoods, copyright, or the growing risk of deepfakes and misinformation? When images lie as easily as they entertain, vigilance is no longer optional.
            </p>
            <p>
                So yes, laugh at the melted dog portraits and surreal nightmares, but stay sharp. With great algorithmic power comes great responsibility.
